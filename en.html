                            <p>We use the most common and time-tested tests used worldwide for cognitive function testing. Our platform includes 9 standardized methods:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>**1. Auditory Verbal Memory (Short-Term):** The method is aimed at assessing auditory verbal short-term memory and is an analog of the "Word Span" subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) battery. It has high validity and is widely used in clinical and school diagnostics.</li>
                                <li>**2. Visual-Verbal Memory (Short-Term):** Assessment of visual-verbal associative memory, close to the "Memory for Objects" (NEPSY-II) and "Paired Associates" (WMS) subtests. The methodology is validated for assessing the learning process and forming new connections.</li>
                                <li>**3. Long-Term Auditory Memory:** The method assesses long-term auditory verbal memory and the consolidation of memory traces. It is a standard component of neuropsychological examination and corresponds to the delayed recall stage in RAVLT and WMS tests.</li>
                                <li>**4. Long-Term Visual Memory:** The test assesses long-term visual-verbal memory. Analogs of associative memory methods from NEPSY-II and WMS batteries. Widely used for diagnosing learning and memory disorders of the clinical spectrum.</li>
                                <li>**5. Schulte Tables (Attention Speed):** The Schulte test is a classic method for assessing the speed of switching and concentration of attention. Functionally corresponds to the Trail Making Test (TMT-A) and Symbol Search (WISC). Widely applied in psychological and vocational diagnostics.</li>
                                <li>**6. Number Sequences (Abstract-Logical Thinking):** The method is aimed at assessing inductive logical thinking and working memory. It is a direct analog of the "Number Sequences" and "Arithmetic" subtests from the Wechsler intelligence tests (WISC). It has high validity in assessing logical thinking.</li>
                                <li>**7. Graphic Dictation (Spatial Thinking and Attention Concentration):** The classic method by D.B. Elkonin for assessing voluntary regulation, visuomotor coordination, and spatial thinking. Functionally close to the "Visuomotor Precision" subtest (NEPSY-II). Widely used in diagnosing readiness for school.</li>
                                <li>**8. Logical Problems (Logical Thinking):** The test assesses verbal-logical and deductive thinking. It is the core of many intelligence tests (analogs of the "Similarities" and "Comprehension" subtests from WISC). It belongs to highly valid methods for diagnosing crystallized intelligence.</li>
                                <li>**9. Self-Assessment and Reflection:** The projective method "Ladder" (authors V.G. Shchur, S.G. Yakobson) for studying self-esteem and the concept of the "looking-glass self" (Ch. Cooley, G.H. Mead). Widely used in child counseling and school psychology for the qualitative assessment of the emotional-personal sphere.</li>
