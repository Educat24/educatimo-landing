                    <p>Make your child's progress visible and understandable. It's simple. The teacher registers the
                        student, and the child takes an exciting test on a tablet.</p>
                    <p>No stress or boring exams, under the guidance of a specialist from your organization. The test
                        results are sent to the server.</p>
                    <p>The system instantly analyzes brain parameters and builds an accurate cognitive profile of the
                        student. You see not just a snapshot, but dynamics.</p>
                    <p>Real progress over three months or a year. This is proof of the effectiveness of your classes.
                        Our partners can see all the testing sessions conducted for their students, group them by field
                        of study or age, add and edit specialists from their organization who are involved in conducting
                        and analyzing tests.</p>

                <h3>Based on Science and Experience</h3>
                <p>Our project was created without the help of professional programmers or marketers. This is a solution
                    <strong>from educators for educators</strong>. We first tested this idea in our own children's
                    educational centers, received positive feedback from parents, and saw the children's interest.
                </p>
                <p>Only after that do we invite you to participate in a pilot project, being confident in its
                    effectiveness. We share our experience and welcome new <strong>colleague-practitioners</strong>!</p>
                <p>The Neuro Educatimo project began in 2018 as a local solution for assessing and correcting cognitive
                    functions <strong>in our children's educational centers</strong>. Today, thanks to cooperation with
                    leading neuropsychologists, we have transformed it into a scalable SaaS platform. Our team has 10
                    years of experience in developing educational technologies and guarantees the methodological
                    accuracy of every test and algorithm.</p>

                                testing. Our platform includes 9 standardized methods:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>**1. Auditory Verbal Memory (Short-Term):** The method is aimed at assessing
                                    auditory verbal short-term memory and is an analog of the "Word Span" subtest from
                                    the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) battery. It has high validity and is widely used in
                                    clinical and school diagnostics.</li>
                                <li>**2. Visual-Verbal Memory (Short-Term):** Assessment of visual-verbal associative
                                    memory, close to the "Memory for Objects" (NEPSY-II) and "Paired Associates" (WMS)
                                    subtests. The methodology is validated for assessing the learning process and
                                    forming new connections.</li>
                                <li>**3. Long-Term Auditory Memory:** The method assesses long-term auditory verbal
                                    memory and the consolidation of memory traces. It is a standard component of
                                    neuropsychological examination and corresponds to the delayed recall stage in RAVLT
                                    and WMS tests.</li>
                                <li>**4. Long-Term Visual Memory:** The test assesses long-term visual-verbal memory.
                                    Analogs of associative memory methods from NEPSY-II and WMS batteries. Widely used
                                    for diagnosing learning and memory disorders of the clinical spectrum.</li>
                                <li>**5. Schulte Tables (Attention Speed):** The Schulte test is a classic method for
                                    assessing the speed of switching and concentration of attention. Functionally
                                    corresponds to the Trail Making Test (TMT-A) and Symbol Search (WISC). Widely
                                    applied in psychological and vocational diagnostics.</li>
                                <li>**6. Number Sequences (Abstract-Logical Thinking):** The method is aimed at
                                    assessing inductive logical thinking and working memory. It is a direct analog of
                                    the "Number Sequences" and "Arithmetic" subtests from the Wechsler intelligence
                                    tests (WISC). It has high validity in assessing logical thinking.</li>
                                <li>**7. Graphic Dictation (Spatial Thinking and Attention Concentration):** The classic
                                    method by D.B. Elkonin for assessing voluntary regulation, visuomotor coordination,
                                    and spatial thinking. Functionally close to the "Visuomotor Precision" subtest
                                    (NEPSY-II). Widely used in diagnosing readiness for school.</li>
                                <li>**8. Logical Problems (Logical Thinking):** The test assesses verbal-logical and
                                    deductive thinking. It is the core of many intelligence tests (analogs of the
                                    "Similarities" and "Comprehension" subtests from WISC). It belongs to highly valid
                                    methods for diagnosing crystallized intelligence.</li>
                                <li>**9. Self-Assessment and Reflection:** The projective method "Ladder" (authors V.G.
                                    Shchur, S.G. Yakobson) for studying self-esteem and the concept of the
                                    "looking-glass self" (Ch. Cooley, G.H. Mead). Widely used in child counseling and
                                    school psychology for the qualitative assessment of the emotional-personal sphere.
